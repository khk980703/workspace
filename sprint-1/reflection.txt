Tech :
  
  I've spent my time playing around with all the commands that I've learnt throughout the video including pushing to the github.
  I've deleted the repository made in the video and made a new one with called "workspace" and created all the sprint files for me to access the files efficiently for the future.
  
  Command Line:
    - How would you describe the command line in plain English in a couple of sentences? Can you think of an analogy for it?
      I would say command line could be described as a primitive method of interacting directories and files on our local system.

    - Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?
      I managed to stick most of them to the timebox guidelines, however I've spent a long time organizing the folders and files including pushing to the github.

    - Name five commands you used and what they do.
      cd = changes the directory that you are in to a different one.
      mkdir = make a new directory.
      mv = changes the name of the file or the directory.
      ls = lists the file and directories of the directory you are in.
      cat = outputs the contents of the file.

    - Did you learn anything unexpected?
      Yes a lot! I've learn many new commands that I did not know of and got to practise a bunch. Starting to get confident with the commands.
