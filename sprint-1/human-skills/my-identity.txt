1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
  One time, I found a lost dog wandering around the main street near my house and decided to bring it back to its owner. I wasn't completely sure if I remembered the dog's owner correctly, but I decided to give it a try anyway.
  Luckily, I was right, and the dog was able to make its way home. The owner was so happy and thanked me over and over, which made me feel really proud and joyful.

  I consider myself to be someone who’s a little hesitant and not very adventurous, so stepping into something unfamiliar was a bit challenging for me.
  However, situations like this help me grow and overcome my weaknesses. It built my confidence and made me less hesitant when making decisions.

  Even though I wasn’t entirely sure of the outcome, taking action and seeing a successful result gave me a huge dopamine and a sense of reward that’s hard to describe.
  It was a special experience that I’ll always remember. Now, knowing the satisfaction, I’m more open to trying new things leading to more self-development.


2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
  Usually, I have a good understanding of my weaknesses through self-reflection, however recognizing my own strengths was something I lacked. In this regard, the people around me help me see myself from different perspectives.
  With their support, I’ve discovered many of my strengths, which has given me more confidence in the path I’m on.

  These may have been acknowledged through out the comparison from others, but I believe it's usually from the good words absorbed from my peole ensuring my confidence.
  Although, I do come across realisation of my weaknesses, I value them even more as they give me the opportunity for self-improvement. I love working on these areas to grow and become a better person.


3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
  I believe I possess lots of strengths. I'm a problem solver, hardworking, and persistent when it comes to completing tasks. Among all my strengths, I consider my positive mindset to be the most essencial skill I own.
  It helps me overcome any obstacles I encounter during my learning journey and enables me to successfully complete my tasks.


4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
  My limitation might be that I tend to complete tasks a bit slower than others. I like to deeply understand what I’m learning, and when I work, I can be somewhat of a perfectionist.
  Recognizing this limitation, I try to view myself from a third person's perspective and assess whether I’m striking the right balance in what I’m doing.
  I aim to find the sweet spot between rushing and overworking, ensuring I maintain the best efficiency in completing tasks. By managing this limitation, I believe it can sometimes convert into a strength.

  Secondly, I sometimes may have some trouble asking others for help as I consider myself a fairly independant person. However, I’ve come to realize that trying to handle everything on my own for a long time isn’t the most efficient way to make progress.
  Therefore, I seek for help more often and make an effort to share my thoughts as much as possible. Now, I’ve started to enjoy overcoming this limitation and becoming more communicative.
  Overall, I am really looking forward to the collaborative work environment in our bootcamp learning.


5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
  I don’t often encounter situations like that, but I did experience a minor conflict once while working with others. In that case, there was already some miscommunication between us.
  To resolve it, I first made an effort to listen to the opposition's opinion and really try to understand their perspective and their argument. If I could coordinate a middle ground, I would propose a compromise. 
  Otherwise, I would persuade the reasons behind our disagreement with the clarification of my own perspective, and try to find an alternative solution that would benefit both of us.
